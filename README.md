This is an E-Commerce website which speciaizes in selling ladies products for all age groups. The website provides 33,000 products of different types Perfume, Lipstick, Foundations, and other related to cosmetics products .

In this project we have tried to manipulate dom elements, styling using css and tried to make website more dynamic and responsive. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned till Unit-4 in the Masai School, we were able to clone the whole website with same looking & features.


# Technology Stack Used ðŸŒŸ
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

For storing user data we also used localStorage , JSON-Server.

## How to run the Project
* Open pages directory.
* Open index.html using live server.

## End Notes ðŸ“‘
In this project we were tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible. This entire journey of this construct week has given us experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and functionality of the website is achieved.

## Limitations
Pages are not responsive yet , those pages are might not be properly visible on small screen devices.
